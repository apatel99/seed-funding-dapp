# Project Name: Distributed Seed Fund Application

# Author: Anish Patel (@apatel99)

# Description of the Project 

A layer 2 solution to generate rewards distributing contracts for a seed funding company. Consider a company sets certain amount of money as a target for seed funding. Following the implementation here, it’ll continue to accept participants to fund the contract. Moving forward the think tank for this company would analyze the current market opportunities and invest that money in appropriate growing sector. For instance healthcare, power, banking, Information Technology etc. After a certain period of time it’d distribute the return on investments with all the participants.

# Problem specification related to ERC 1973

The information revolution has took a huge leap in the past decade and startups are everywhere. In such a scenario companies like indigego and kickstarter have opened new ways to invest. This also backs small scale startups to ensure their initial capital requirements from such initiatives. On the other hand are some big names like Y Combinator and others. I want to implement such an idea on a distributed network. The problem is also about creating a model to share the returns in flexible thus scalable fashion. Inspiration from these ideas and introduction of ERC 1973 make a blend of rewards and investment.

# Solution in relation to ERC 1973 

I propose a digital distributed solution for seed funding organization. In my contract I’ll be implementing the factory pattern to yield contracts for every sector mentioned above. Since I am using the factory pattern, every instance of the contract would be dedicated for one specific project. As mentioned earlier the contract would continue to accept funds from participants and keep building strategies to distribute rewards that would come up in future with the help of ERC 1973 and ERC20. After a certain block interval of say 1000 blocks, it’d distribute the return on investments with all the participants following the ERC1973 implementation of scalable rewards distribution.
The investors can then exchange the ERC1973 tokens for stable coins with the firm as and when they wish to. By using ERC 1973 we are able to scale our project, as gas is the bottleneck for Ethereum and blockchain transactions, in general. For such a use case such an implementation proves to be useful. Also, in future we can delegate the decision making responsibility to the investors too. So there are many possibilities in future but we'd stick to the basic implementation so as to understand the working of ERC 1973 for this use case.
